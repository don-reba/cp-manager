!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

!========================= PrPixel v1r10 2014-10-14 =========================
! 2014-09-22 - Manuel Tobias Schiller
 - changed PrPixelHit class to save 1/error instead of 1/error^2 - exploiting
   hit-level parallelism in chi^2 fits becomes easier this way; for now,
   client code should run without modification (and without change in
   performance)

!========================= PrPixel v1r9 2014-09-08 =========================
! 2014-07-23 - Daniel Hugo Campora Perez
 - Type conversion carried over most of the code from double to single
   floating point precision.
 - PrPixelTrack fit and covariance functions coded in SSE / SSE2 intrinsics.

!========================= PrPixel v1r8 2014-07-14 =========================
! 2014-06-30 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Move bulk of debugging histograms from PrPixelTracking to new algorithm 
   PrPixelMonitor.

! 2014-06-16 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Stop search for pairs two stations earlier.
 - PrPixelTrack: remove unused member m_backward and functions first/lastModule.
 - Don't recompute straight-line fit parameters progressively for each new hit,
   but only when requested explicitly (PrPixelTrack::fit).
 - Use auto iterators.
 
!========================= PrPixel v1r7 2014-05-13 =========================
! 2014-05-08 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Remove unused functions removeHit, all3SensorsAreDifferent from PrPixelTrack

! 2014-05-04 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Remove forgotten m_useSlopeCorrection member in PrPixelHitManager
 - clang-format

! 2014-04-30 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Remove slope correction option (to be reimplemented in VPDet or cluster 
   position tool after retuning for binary readout)

! 2014-04-26 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Replace Tf/PatKernel by Pr/PrKernel in CMakeLists.txt and cmt/requirements

! 2014-04-25 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Follow changes in VPChannelID format (r171869).
 - Use IPrDebugTool instead of IPatDebugTool.

! 2014-04-17 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Change condition for rebuilding geometry (following r171666).

! 2014-04-07 - Kurt Rinnert
 - change default to unlimited cluster size when running on Super Pixel raw
   banks. This is to avoid changes in results when we switch over. Cuts will
   help, but this needs a detailed study before deployment.
 - help the compiler with out of order execution and constness in various places.
 - avoid calling into sqrt() in hot PrPixelTracking::bestHit() method. 

! 2014-04-06 - Kurt Rinnert
 - avoid mixing double and float (this is very expensive!).
 - cache global x of first hit on a module.

! 2014-04-05 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Change default value of RunOnRawBanks to True.

! 2014-04-04 - Kurt Rinnert
 - Assign proper keys when inserting clusters in container.

! 2014-04-01 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Pickup VPClusters instead of VPLiteClusters.

! 2014-03-31 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Follow changes in VPCluster format (revision r170715)

!========================= PrPixel v1r6 2014-03-18 =========================
! 2014-03-14 - Kurt Rinnert
 - named cluster storing algorithm more aptly.

! 2014-03-13 - Kurt Rinnert
 - Store 3D point information when creating VPClusters.

! 2014-03-13 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Follow changes in VPCluster format and path (revision r169999).

! 2014-03-12 - Kurt Rinnert
 - improved documentation and clean up of new code.
 - prepared for upcoming new event model and cluster storage after track
   finding (clustering without pattern recognition will work transparently for
   fast monitoring purposes).
 - introduced runtime switch for trigger or offline configuration. The pattern
   recognition results are the same in both cases, but the clusters put on
   the TES will potentially be different, depending on the maximum cluster
   size passed to the track finding algorithm.
 - the default code path is still the same old thing based on a lite cluster
   raw bank, but should become obsolete soon. Even then old MC will still work
   transparently, including MC matching, although you can't expect bit-perfect
   results.

! 2014-03-10 - Kurt Rinnert
 - added code to run the tracking directly from raw banks. This is completely
   transparent; the bank version determines how the bank is interpreted. This
   code branch is not active by default yet, so no change in the results for
   now.
 - some clean up of recently addded code.

! 2014-03-04 - Kurt Rinnert
 - bug fix in PrPixelHitManager: the size of of clusters in super pixel
   patterns was off by one (legacy debugging code).
 - bug fix in PrPixelClustering: matched super pixel clusters sometimes
   received the wrong sensor column number (wrong grouping of integer
   divisions).
 - simplified generic clustering code in PrPixelClustering: the latest attempt
   at agressive row scan optimization didn't do any good and obfuscated the
   code; it has been reverted to a more generic approach.
 - none of these changes affect code running in the current Brunel branches;
   they have no effect on the results (until activated).

! 2014-02-28 - Kurt Rinnert
 - fixed bug in PrPixelHitManager::buildHits(): the sensor pixel column was
   computed wrongly due to writing SENSOR_COLUMNS were it should have been
   CHIP_COLUMNS. This is what caused the garbage VP tracking results in the
   last nightly build.
 - re-instantiated chi^2 rejection fix that was accidentally globbered by the
   last commit.

! 2014-02-28 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Fixed CMake configuration.

! 2014-02-27 - Kurt Rinnert
 - use new features of DeVPSensor to speed up 3D point building.
 - additional various optimizations (cache global transforms, PrPixelModule 
   object pool ...).
 - added possibility to do clustering and 3D hit building directly from
   super pixel raw banks.
 - added clustering algorithm creatinf VPLiteClusters from super pixel raw
   bank.

!========================= PatPixel v1r4 2013-12-10 =========================
! 2013-12-05 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Removed unused variables, changed default values

!========================= PatPixel v1r3 2013-10-24 =========================

!========================= PatPixel v1r2 2013-10-01 =========================
! 2013-09-27 - Heinrich Schindler

 - Added flag to use slope dependent correction in position calculation or not
 - Some cleanup in PatPixelTracking 

! 2013-09-25 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Modifications for use with new XML and detector element hierarchy
 - Moved track extrapolation to PatPixelTracking

! 2013-09-03 - Pawel Jalocha
 - tracks fit on multiple scattering model, instead of a straight line,
   improves hit efficiency (and IP resolution as a result)
 - code not very clean and not final: more a test of the new concept

! 2013-08-25 - Heinrich Schindler
 - Replace direct calls to DeVPSquareType 

!========================= PatPixel v1r1 2013-06-03 =========================
! 2013-05-28 - Wouter Hulsbergen
 - implemented a simple fixed-noise kalman filter to improve IP resolution

! 2013-05-24 - Marco Cattaneo
 - Include missing PatKernel dependency

!========================= PatPixel v1r0 2013-02-14 =========================
! 2013-02-08 - Diego Martinez Santos
 - Added correction to the bias in cluster positions, as well as a slope
   dependent correction for two pixel clusters. 
   This might cause for the moment a loss of speed.

! 2013-02-08 - Marco Clemencic
 - Fixed compilation with CMake.

! 2013-02-01 - Sascha Stahl
 - Added CMake file

! 2013-01-30 - Olivier Callot
 - Add option "ClearHits" to clear the hits, for rerunning the VP pattern twice.

! 2012-12-09 - Pawel Jalocha
 - debug histograms added (activate with DEBUG_HISTO)
 - added comments, as I understand the code works

! 2012-01-17 - Olivier Callot
 - Re-implementation of the algorithm, based on finding a pair of consecutive hits
   and extrapolating in both directions.
   Tested on 900 events: 0.9% ghosts, 99.7% efficient, 0.5% clones, 1.35 ms/event
   Improvements are possible, but a better clustering is probably the most 
   important one

! 2012-01-10 - Olivier Callot
 - First version. The overall structure is taken form FastVelo.
   New logic to make the search: Find enough hits in a seed region before 
   extrapolating. This seed region can extend acroos the half detector boundary.

   Initial performance is great:  <2% ghosts, >99.5% efficiency for long > 5 GeV,
                                  <0.5% clones, and only < 1.5 ms per event. 
      This is obtained on a limited sample.
